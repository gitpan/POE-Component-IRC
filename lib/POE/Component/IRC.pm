=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::IRC is a POE component (who'd have guessed?) which
acts as an easily controllable IRC client for your other POE
components and sessions. You create an IRC component and tell it what
events your session cares about and where to connect to, and it sends
back interesting IRC events when they happen. You make the client do
things by sending it events. That's all there is to it. Cool, no?

[Note that using this module requires some familiarity with the
details of the IRC protocol. I'd advise you to read up on the gory
details of RFC 1459 (L<http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1459.html>) before you
get started. Keep the list of server numeric codes handy while you
program. Needless to say, you'll also need a good working knowledge of
POE, or this document will be of very little use to you.]

The POE::Component::IRC distribution has a docs/ folder with a collection of
salient documentation including the pertinent RFCs.

POE::Component::IRC consists of a POE::Session that manages the IRC connection
and dispatches 'irc_' prefixed events to interested sessions and 
an object that can be used to access additional information using methods.

Sessions register their interest in receiving 'irc_' events by sending
'register' to the component. One would usually do this in your _start handler.
Your session will continue to receive events until you 'unregister'. The
component will continue to stay around until you tell it not to with 'shutdown'.

The SYNOPSIS demonstrates a fairly basic bot.

=head2 Useful subclasses

Included with POE::Component::IRC are a number of useful subclasses. As they
are subclasses they support all the methods, etc. documented here and have
additional methods and quirks which are documented separately:

=over

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::State|POE::Component::IRC::State>

POE::Component::IRC::State provides all the functionality of POE::Component::IRC
 but also tracks IRC state entities such as nicks and channels.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Qnet|POE::Component::IRC::Qnet>

POE::Component::IRC::Qnet is POE::Component::IRC tweaked for use on Quakenet IRC
 network.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Qnet::State|POE::Component::IRC::Qnet::State>

POE::Component::IRC::Qnet::State is a tweaked version of POE::Component::IRC::State
for use on Quakenet IRC network. 

=back

=head2 The Plugin system

As of 3.7, PoCo-IRC sports a plugin system. The documentation for it can be
read by looking at L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin>. That is not a subclass, just
a placeholder for documentation!

A number of useful plugins have made their way into the core distribution:

=over 

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::AutoJoin|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::AutoJoin>

Keeps you on your favorite channels throughout reconnects and even kicks.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Connector|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Connector>

Glues an irc bot to an IRC network, ie. deals with maintaining ircd connections.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::BotTraffic|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::BotTraffic>

Under normal circumstances irc bots do not normal the msgs and public msgs that
they generate themselves. This plugin enables you to handle those events.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::BotAddressed|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::BotAddressed>

Generates 'irc_bot_addressed' / 'irc_bot_mentioned' / 'irc_bot_mentioned_action'
events whenever your bot's name comes up in channel discussion.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Console|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Console>

See inside the component. See what events are being sent. Generate irc commands
manually. A TCP based console.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::FollowTail|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::FollowTail>

Follow the tail of an ever-growing file.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Logger|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Logger>

Log public and private messages to disk.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::NickServID|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::NickServID>

Identify with FreeNode's NickServ when needed.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Proxy|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Proxy>

A lightweight IRC proxy/bouncer.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::CTCP|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::CTCP>

Automagically generates replies to ctcp version, time and userinfo queries.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::PlugMan|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::PlugMan>

An experimental Plugin Manager plugin.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::NickReclaim|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::NickReclaim>

Automagically deals with your nickname being in use and reclaiming it.

=item L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::CycleEmpty|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::CycleEmpty>

Cycles (parts and rejoins) channels if they become empty and opless, in order
to gain ops.

=back

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

Both CONSTRUCTORS return an object. The object is also available within 'irc_'
event handlers by using 
$_[SENDER]->get_heap(). See also 'register' and 'irc_registered'.

=over

=item C<spawn>

Takes a number of arguments, all of which are optional: 

'alias', a name (kernel alias) that this instance will be known by;

'options', a hashref containing POE::Session options;

'Server', the server name;

'Port', the remote port number;

'Password', an optional password for restricted servers;

'Nick', your client's IRC nickname;

'Username', your client's username;

'Ircname', some cute comment or something.

'UseSSL', set to some true value if you want to connect using SSL.

'Raw', set to some true value to enable the component to send 'irc_raw' events.

'LocalAddr', which local IP address on a multihomed box to connect as;

'LocalPort', the local TCP port to open your socket on;

'NoDNS', set this to 1 to disable DNS lookups using PoCo-Client-DNS. (See note
below).

'Flood', set this to 1 to get quickly disconnected and klined from an ircd >;]

'Proxy', IP address or server name of a proxy server to use.

'ProxyPort', which tcp port on the proxy to connect to.

'NATAddr', what other clients see as your IP address.

'DCCPorts', an arrayref containing tcp ports that can be used for DCC sends.

'Resolver', provide a POE::Component::Client::DNS object for the component to
use.

'plugin_debug', set to some true value to print plugin debug info, default 0.

'socks_proxy', specify a SOCKS4/SOCKS4a proxy to use.

'socks_port', the SOCKS port to use, defaults to 1080 if not specified.

'socks_id', specify a SOCKS user_id. Default is none.

'useipv6', enable the use of IPv6 for connections.

C<spawn> will supply
reasonable defaults for any of these attributes which are missing, so
don't feel obliged to write them all out.

All the above options may be supplied to C<connect()> input event as well.

If the component finds that L<POE::Component::Client::DNS|POE::Component::Client::DNS>
is installed it will use that to resolve the server name passed. Disable this
behaviour if you like, by passing: NoDNS => 1.

Additionally there is a "Flood" parameter.  When true, it disables the
component's flood protection algorithms, allowing it to send messages
to an IRC server at full speed.  Disconnects and k-lines are some
common side effects of flooding IRC servers, so care should be used
when enabling this option.

Two new attributes are "Proxy" and "ProxyPort" for sending your
IRC traffic through a proxy server.  "Proxy"'s value should be the IP
address or server name of the proxy.  "ProxyPort"'s value should be the
port on the proxy to connect to.  C<connect()> will default to using the
I<actual> IRC server's port if you provide a proxy but omit the proxy's
port. These are for HTTP Proxies. See 'socks_proxy' for SOCKS4 and SOCKS4a
support.

For those people who run bots behind firewalls and/or Network Address
Translation there are two additional attributes for DCC. "DCCPorts", is an
arrayref of ports to use when initiating DCC, using dcc(). "NATAddr", is the
NAT'ed IP address that your bot is hidden behind, this is sent whenever you
do DCC.

SSL support requires POE::Component::SSLify, as well as an IRC server that
supports SSL connections. If you're missing POE::Component::SSLify, specifing
'UseSSL' will do nothing. The default is to not try to use SSL.

Setting 'Raw' to true, will enable the component to send 'irc_raw' events to
interested plugins and sessions. See below for more details on what a 'irc_raw'
events is :)

'NoDNS' has different results depending on whether it is set with spawn() or
connect(). Setting it with spawn(), disables the creation of the
POE::Component::Client::DNS completely. Setting it with connect() on the other
hand allows the PoCo-Client-DNS session to be spawned, but will disable any
dns lookups using it.

'Resolver', requires a POE::Component::Client::DNS object. Useful when spawning
multiple poco-irc sessions, saves the overhead of multiple dns sessions.

'plugin_debug', setting to true enables plugin debug info. Plugins are processed
inside an eval, so debugging them can be hard. This should help with that.

SOCKS4 proxy support is provided by 'socks_proxy', 'socks_port' and 'socks_id'
parameters. If something goes wrong with the SOCKS connection you should get a
warning on STDERR. This is fairly experimental currently.

IPv6 support is available for connecting to IPv6 enabled ircds (it won't work
for DCC though). To enable it, specify 'useipv6'. L<Socket6|Socket6> is required to be
installed. If you have L<Socket6|Socket6> and L<POE::Component::Client::DNS|POE::Component::Client::DNS>
installed and specify a hostname that resolves to an IPv6 address then IPv6
will be used. If you specify an ipv6 'localaddr' then IPv6 will be used.

=item C<new>

This method is deprecated. See 'spawn' method instead.
Takes one argument: a name (kernel alias) which this new connection
will be known by. Returns a POE::Component::IRC object :)
Use of this method will generate a warning. There are currently no plans to
make it die() >;]

=back

=head1 METHODS

These are methods supported by the POE::Component::IRC object. 

=over

=item C<server_name>

Takes no arguments. Returns the name of the IRC server that the component
is currently connected to.

=item C<nick_name>

Takes no arguments. Returns a scalar containing the current nickname that the
bot is using.

=item C<session_id>

Takes no arguments. Returns the ID of the component's session. Ideal for posting
events to the component.

 $kernel->post( $irc->session_id() => 'mode' => $channel => '+o' => $dude );

=item C<session_alias>

Takes no arguments. Returns the session alias that has been set through
spawn()'s alias argument. 

=item C<version>

Takes no arguments. Returns the version number of the module.

=item C<send_queue>

The component provides anti-flood throttling. This method takes no arguments
and returns a scalar representing the number of messages that are queued up
waiting for dispatch to the irc server.

=item C<connected>

Takes no arguments. Returns true or false depending on whether the component is
currently connected to an IRC network or not.

=item C<disconnect>

Takes no arguments. Terminates the socket connection disgracefully >;o]

=item C<raw_events>

With no arguments, returns true or false depending on whether 'irc_raw' events
are being  generated or not. Provide a true or false argument to enable or
disable this feature accordingly.

=item C<isupport>

Takes one argument, a server capability to query. Returns undef on failure or a
value representing the applicable capability. A full list of capabilities is
available at L<http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/005.html>.

=item C<isupport_dump_keys>

Takes no arguments, returns a list of the available server capabilities keys,
which can be used with isupport().

=item C<yield>

This method provides an alternative object based means of posting events to the
component. First argument is the event to post, following arguments are sent as
arguments to the resultant post.

 $irc->yield(mode => $channel => '+o' => $dude);

=item C<call>

This method provides an alternative object based means of calling events to the
component. First argument is the event to call, following arguments are sent as
arguments to the resultant
call.

 $irc->call(mode => $channel => '+o' => $dude);

=item C<delay>

This method provides a way of posting delayed events to the component. The
first argument is an arrayref consisting of the delayed command to post and
any command arguments. The second argument is the time in seconds that one
wishes to delay the command being posted.

 my $alarm_id = $irc->delay( [ mode => $channel => '+o' => $dude ], 60 );

Returns an alarm ID that can be used with delay_remove() to cancel the delayed
event. This will be undefined if something went wrong.

=item C<delay_remove>

This method removes a previously scheduled delayed event from the component.
Takes one argument, the alarm_id that was returned by a delay() method call.

 my $arrayref = $irc->delay_remove( $alarm_id );

Returns an arrayref that was originally requested to be delayed.

=item C<resolver>

Returns a reference to the L<POE::Component::Client::DNS|POE::Component::Client::DNS>
object that is internally created by the component.

=item C<pipeline>

Returns a reference to the L<POE::Component::IRC::Pipeline|POE::Component::IRC::Pipeline>
object used by the plugin system.

=item C<send_event>

Sends an event through the components event handling system. These will get
processed by  plugins then by registered sessions. First argument is the event
name, followed by any parameters for that event.

=back

=head1 INPUT

How to talk to your new IRC component... here's the events we'll accept.
These are events that are posted to the component, either via
$poe_kernel->post() or via the object method yield().

So the following would be functionally equivalent:

 sub irc_001 {
     my ($kernel,$sender) = @_[KERNEL,SENDER];
     my $irc = $sender->get_heap(); # obtain the poco's object

     $irc->yield( privmsg => 'foo' => 'Howdy!' );
     $kernel->post( $sender => privmsg => 'foo' => 'Howdy!' );
     $kernel->post( $irc->session_id() => privmsg => 'foo' => 'Howdy!' );
     $kernel->post( $irc->session_alias() => privmsg => 'foo' => 'Howdy!' );

     return;
 }

=head2 Important Commands

=over

=item C<register>

Takes N arguments: a list of event names that your session wants to
listen for, minus the "irc_" prefix. So, for instance, if you just
want a bot that keeps track of which people are on a channel, you'll
need to listen for JOINs, PARTs, QUITs, and KICKs to people on the
channel you're in. You'd tell POE::Component::IRC that you want those
events by saying this:

 $kernel->post( 'my client', 'register', qw(join part quit kick) );

Then, whenever people enter or leave a channel your bot is on (forcibly
or not), your session will receive events with names like "irc_join",
"irc_kick", etc., which you can use to update a list of people on the
channel.

Registering for C<'all'> will cause it to send all IRC-related events to
you; this is the easiest way to handle it. See the test script for an
example.

Registering will generate an 'irc_registered' event that your session can
trap. ARG0 is the components object. Useful if you want to bolt PoCo-IRC's
new features such as Plugins into a bot coded to the older deprecated API.
If you are using the new API, ignore this :)

Registering with multiple component sessions can be tricky, especially if
one wants to marry up sessions/objects, etc. Check 'SIGNALS' section of this
documentation for an alternative method of registering with multiple poco-ircs.

Starting with version 4.96, if you spawn the component from inside another POE
session, the component will automatically register that session as wanting 'all'
irc events. That session will receive an 'irc_registered' event indicating that
the component is up and ready to go.

=item C<connect>

Takes one argument: a hash reference of attributes for the new
connection, see C<spawn()> for details. This event tells the IRC client to
connect to a new/different server. If it has a connection already open, it'll
close it gracefully before reconnecting.

=item C<ctcp> and C<ctcpreply>

Sends a CTCP query or response to the nick(s) or channel(s) which you
specify. Takes 2 arguments: the nick or channel to send a message to
(use an array reference here to specify multiple recipients), and the
plain text of the message to send (the CTCP quoting will be handled
for you). The "/me" command in popular IRC clients is actually a CTCP action.

 # Doing a /me 
 $poe_kernel->post( $irc_session => ctcp => $channel => 'ACTION dances.' );

=item C<dcc>

Send a DCC SEND or CHAT request to another person. Takes at least two
arguments: the nickname of the person to send the request to and the
type of DCC request (SEND or CHAT). For SEND requests, be sure to add
a third argument for the filename you want to send. Optionally, you
can add a fourth argument for the DCC transfer blocksize, but the
default of 1024 should usually be fine.

Incidentally, you can send other weird nonstandard kinds of DCCs too;
just put something besides 'SEND' or 'CHAT' (say, "FOO") in the type
field, and you'll get back "irc_dcc_foo" events when activity happens
on its DCC connection.

If you are behind a firewall or Network Address Translation, you may want to
consult 'connect()' for some parameters that are useful with this command.

=item C<dcc_accept>

Accepts an incoming DCC connection from another host. First argument:
the magic cookie from an 'irc_dcc_request' event. In the case of a DCC
GET, the second argument can optionally specify a new name for the
destination file of the DCC transfer, instead of using the sender's name
for it. (See the 'irc_dcc_request' section below for more details.)

=item C<dcc_chat>

Sends lines of data to the person on the other side of a DCC CHAT
connection. Takes any number of arguments: the magic cookie from an
'irc_dcc_start' event, followed by the data you wish to send. (It'll be
chunked into lines by a POE::Filter::Line for you, don't worry.)

=item C<dcc_close>

Terminates a DCC SEND or GET connection prematurely, and causes DCC CHAT
connections to close gracefully. Takes one argument: the magic cookie
from an 'irc_dcc_start' or 'irc_dcc_request' event.

=item C<join>

Tells your IRC client to join a single channel of your choice. Takes
at least one arg: the channel name (required) and the channel key
(optional, for password-protected channels).

=item C<kick>

Tell the IRC server to forcibly evict a user from a particular
channel. Takes at least 2 arguments: a channel name, the nick of the
user to boot, and an optional witty message to show them as they sail
out the door.

=item C<remove> (FreeNode only)

Tell the IRC server to forcibly evict a user from a particular
channel. Takes at least 2 arguments: a channel name, the nick of the
user to boot, and an optional witty message to show them as they sail
out the door. Similar to KICK but does an enforced PART instead.

=item C<mode>

Request a mode change on a particular channel or user. Takes at least
one argument: the mode changes to effect, as a single string (e.g.,
"+sm-p+o"), and any number of optional operands to the mode changes
(nicks, hostmasks, channel keys, whatever.) Or just pass them all as one
big string and it'll still work, whatever. I regret that I haven't the
patience now to write a detailed explanation, but serious IRC users know
the details anyhow.

=item C<nick>

Allows you to change your nickname. Takes exactly one argument: the
new username that you'd like to be known as.

=item C<nickserv> (FreeNode only)

Talks to FreeNode's NickServ. Takes any number of arguments.

=item C<notice>

Sends a NOTICE message to the nick(s) or channel(s) which you
specify. Takes 2 arguments: the nick or channel to send a notice to
(use an array reference here to specify multiple recipients), and the
text of the notice to send.

=item C<part>

Tell your IRC client to leave the channels which you pass to it. Takes
any number of arguments: channel names to depart from. If the last argument
doesn't begin with a channel name identifier or contains a space character,
it will be treated as a PART message and dealt with accordingly.

=item C<privmsg>

Sends a public or private message to the nick(s) or channel(s) which
you specify. Takes 2 arguments: the nick or channel to send a message
to (use an array reference here to specify multiple recipients), and
the text of the message to send.

To send IRC colours wrap the text you want coloured with \x03 followed
by the colour code, your text and a \x03 to switch back.

 $kernel->post( $sender => privmsg => $channel => "Foo \x034bar\x03" );

The colour codes are:

 00 # White
 01 # Black
 02 # Dark Blue
 03 # Dark Green
 04 # Red
 05 # Brown
 06 # Purple
 07 # Orange
 08 # Yellow
 09 # Light Green
 10 # Teal
 11 # Cyan
 12 # Light Blue
 13 # Magenta
 14 # Dark Grey
 15 # Light Grey

You can also use color/formatting constants defined in
L<POE::Component::IRC::Common|POE::Component::IRC::Common>.

=item C<quit>

Tells the IRC server to disconnect you. Takes one optional argument:
some clever, witty string that other users in your channels will see
as you leave. You can expect to get an C<irc_disconnect> event shortly
after sending this.

=item C<shutdown>

By default, POE::Component::IRC sessions never go away. Even after
they're disconnected, they're still sitting around in the background,
waiting for you to call C<connect()> on them again to reconnect.
(Whether this behavior is the Right Thing is doubtful, but I don't want
to break backwards compatibility at this point.) You can send the IRC
session a C<shutdown> event manually to make it delete itself.

If you are connected, 'shutdown' will send a quit message to ircd and
disconnect. If you provide an argument that will be used as the QUIT
message.

Terminating multiple components can be tricky. Check the 'SIGNALS' section of
this documentation for an alternative method of shutting down multiple poco-ircs.

=item C<unregister>

Takes N arguments: a list of event names which you I<don't> want to
receive. If you've previously done a 'register' for a particular event
which you no longer care about, this event will tell the IRC
connection to stop sending them to you. (If you haven't, it just
ignores you. No big deal.)

If you have registered with 'all', attempting to unregister individual 
events such as 'mode', etc. will not work. This is a 'feature'.

=item C<debug>

Takes 1 argument: 0 to turn debugging off or 1 to turn debugging on.
This turns debugging on in POE::Filter::IRC::Compat, POE::Filter::CTCP, and
POE::Component::IRC. This has the same effect as setting Debug to true
in 'connect'.

=back

=head2 Not-So-Important Commands

=over

=item C<admin>

Asks your server who your friendly neighborhood server administrators
are. If you prefer, you can pass it a server name to query, instead of
asking the server you're currently on.

=item C<away>

When sent with an argument (a message describig where you went), the
server will note that you're now away from your machine or otherwise
preoccupied, and pass your message along to anyone who tries to
communicate with you. When sent without arguments, it tells the server
that you're back and paying attention.

=item C<info>

Basically the same as the "version" command, except that the server is
permitted to return any information about itself that it thinks is
relevant. There's some nice, specific standards-writing for ya, eh?

=item C<invite>

Invites another user onto an invite-only channel. Takes 2 arguments:
the nick of the user you wish to admit, and the name of the channel to
invite them to.

=item C<ison>

Asks the IRC server which users out of a list of nicknames are
currently online. Takes any number of arguments: a list of nicknames
to query the IRC server about.

=item C<links>

Asks the server for a list of servers connected to the IRC
network. Takes two optional arguments, which I'm too lazy to document
here, so all you would-be linklooker writers should probably go dig up
the RFC.

=item C<list>

Asks the server for a list of visible channels and their topics. Takes
any number of optional arguments: names of channels to get topic
information for. If called without any channel names, it'll list every
visible channel on the IRC network. This is usually a really big list,
so don't do this often.

=item C<motd>

Request the server's "Message of the Day", a document which typically
contains stuff like the server's acceptable use policy and admin
contact email addresses, et cetera. Normally you'll automatically
receive this when you log into a server, but if you want it again,
here's how to do it. If you'd like to get the MOTD for a server other
than the one you're logged into, pass it the server's hostname as an
argument; otherwise, no arguments.

=item C<names>

Asks the server for a list of nicknames on particular channels. Takes
any number of arguments: names of channels to get lists of users
for. If called without any channel names, it'll tell you the nicks of
everyone on the IRC network. This is a really big list, so don't do
this much.

=item C<quote>

Sends a raw line of text to the server. Takes one argument: a string
of a raw IRC command to send to the server. It is more optimal to use
the events this module supplies instead of writing raw IRC commands
yourself.

=item C<stats>

Returns some information about a server. Kinda complicated and not
terribly commonly used, so look it up in the RFC if you're
curious. Takes as many arguments as you please.

=item C<time>

Asks the server what time it thinks it is, which it will return in a
human-readable form. Takes one optional argument: a server name to
query. If not supplied, defaults to current server.

=item C<topic>

Retrieves or sets the topic for particular channel. If called with just
the channel name as an argument, it will ask the server to return the
current topic. If called with the channel name and a string, it will
set the channel topic to that string. Supply an empty string to unset a
channel topic.

=item C<trace>

If you pass a server name or nick along with this request, it asks the
server for the list of servers in between you and the thing you
mentioned. If sent with no arguments, it will show you all the servers
which are connected to your current server.

=item C<userhost>

Asks the IRC server for information about particular nicknames. (The
RFC doesn't define exactly what this is supposed to return.) Takes any
number of arguments: the nicknames to look up.

=item C<users>

Asks the server how many users are logged into it. Defaults to the
server you're currently logged into; however, you can pass a server
name as the first argument to query some other machine instead.

=item C<version>

Asks the server about the version of ircd that it's running. Takes one
optional argument: a server name to query. If not supplied, defaults
to current server.

=item C<who>

Lists the logged-on users matching a particular channel name, hostname,
nickname, or what-have-you. Takes one optional argument: a string for
it to search for. Wildcards are allowed; in the absence of this
argument, it will return everyone who's currently logged in (bad
move). Tack an "o" on the end if you want to list only IRCops, as per
the RFC.

=item C<whois>

Queries the IRC server for detailed information about a particular
user. Takes any number of arguments: nicknames or hostmasks to ask for
information about. As of version 3.2, you will receive an 'irc_whois'
event in addition to the usual numeric responses. See below for details.

=item C<whowas>

Asks the server for information about nickname which is no longer
connected. Takes at least one argument: a nickname to look up (no
wildcards allowed), the optional maximum number of history entries to
return, and the optional server hostname to query. As of version 3.2,
you will receive an 'irc_whowas' event in addition to the usual numeric
responses. See below for details.

=item C<ping> and C<pong>

Included for completeness sake. The component will deal with ponging to
pings automatically. Don't worry about it.

=head2 Purely Esoteric Commands

=over

=item C<locops>

Opers-only command. This one sends a message to all currently
logged-on local-opers (+l).  This option is specific to EFNet.

=item C<oper>

In the exceedingly unlikely event that you happen to be an IRC
operator, you can use this command to authenticate with your IRC
server. Takes 2 arguments: your username and your password.

=item C<operwall>

Opers-only command. This one sends a message to all currently
logged-on global opers.  This option is specific to EFNet.

=item C<srehash>

Tells the IRC server you're connected to, to rehash its configuration
files. Only useful for IRCops. Takes no arguments.

=item C<die>

Tells the IRC server you're connect to, to terminate. Only useful for
IRCops, thank goodness. Takes no arguments. 

=item C<restart>

Tells the IRC server you're connected to, to shut down and restart itself.
Only useful for IRCops, thank goodness. Takes no arguments.

=item C<sconnect>

Tells one IRC server (which you have operator status on) to connect to
another. This is actually the CONNECT command, but I already had an
event called 'connect', so too bad. Takes the args you'd expect: a
server to connect to, an optional port to connect on, and an optional
remote server to connect with, instead of the one you're currently on.

=item C<summon>

Don't even ask.

=item C<wallops>

Another opers-only command. This one sends a message to all currently
logged-on opers (and +w users); sort of a mass PA system for the IRC
server administrators. Takes one argument: some clever, witty message
to send.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The events you will receive (or can ask to receive) from your running
IRC component. Note that all incoming event names your session will
receive are prefixed by "irc_", to inhibit event namespace pollution.

If you wish, you can ask the client to send you every event it
generates. Simply register for the event name "all". This is a lot
easier than writing a huge list of things you specifically want to
listen for. FIXME: I'd really like to classify these somewhat
("basic", "oper", "ctcp", "dcc", "raw" or some such), and I'd welcome
suggestions for ways to make this easier on the user, if you can think
of some.

In your event handlers, $_[SENDER] is the particular component session that
sent you the event. $_[SENDER]->get_heap() will retrieve the component's 
object. Useful if you want on-the-fly access to the object and it's methods.

=head2 Important Events

=over

=item C<irc_connected>

The IRC component will send an "irc_connected" event as soon as it
establishes a connection to an IRC server, before attempting to log
in. ARG0 is the server name.

B<NOTE:> When you get an "irc_connected" event, this doesn't mean you
can start sending commands to the server yet. Wait until you receive
an irc_001 event (the server welcome message) before actually sending
anything back to the server.

=item C<irc_ctcp>

irc_ctcp events are generated upon receipt of CTCP messages, in addition to
the irc_ctcp_* events mentioned below.  They are identical in every way to
these, with one difference: instead of the * being in the method name, it
is prepended to the argument list.  For example, if someone types C</ctcp
Flibble foo bar>, an irc_ctcp event will be sent with C<foo> as ARG0,
and the rest as given below.

It is not recommended that you register for both irc_ctcp and irc_ctcp_*
events, since they will both be fired and presumably cause duplication.

=item C<irc_ctcp_*>

irc_ctcp_whatever events are generated upon receipt of CTCP messages.
For instance, receiving a CTCP PING request generates an irc_ctcp_ping
event, CTCP ACTION (produced by typing "/me" in most IRC clients)
generates an irc_ctcp_action event, blah blah, so on and so forth. ARG0
is the nick!hostmask of the sender. ARG1 is the channel/recipient
name(s). ARG2 is the text of the CTCP message.

Note that DCCs are handled separately -- see the 'irc_dcc_request'
event, below.

=item C<irc_ctcpreply_*>

irc_ctcpreply_whatever messages are just like irc_ctcp_whatever
messages, described above, except that they're generated when a response
to one of your CTCP queries comes back. They have the same arguments and
such as irc_ctcp_* events.

=item C<irc_disconnected>

The counterpart to irc_connected, sent whenever a socket connection
to an IRC server closes down (whether intentionally or
unintentionally). ARG0 is the server name.

=item C<irc_error>

You get this whenever the server sends you an ERROR message. Expect
this to usually be accompanied by the sudden dropping of your
connection. ARG0 is the server's explanation of the error.

=item C<irc_join>

Sent whenever someone joins a channel that you're on. ARG0 is the
person's nick!hostmask. ARG1 is the channel name.

=item C<irc_invite>

Sent whenever someone offers you an invitation to another channel. ARG0
is the person's nick!hostmask. ARG1 is the name of the channel they want
you to join.

=item C<irc_kick>

Sent whenever someone gets booted off a channel that you're on. ARG0
is the kicker's nick!hostmask. ARG1 is the channel name. ARG2 is the
nick of the unfortunate kickee. ARG3 is the explanation string for the
kick.

=item C<irc_mode>

Sent whenever someone changes a channel mode in your presence, or when
you change your own user mode. ARG0 is the nick!hostmask of that
someone. ARG1 is the channel it affects (or your nick, if it's a user
mode change). ARG2 is the mode string (i.e., "+o-b"). The rest of the
args (ARG3 .. $#_) are the operands to the mode string (nicks,
hostmasks, channel keys, whatever).

=item C<irc_msg>

Sent whenever you receive a PRIVMSG command that was addressed to you
privately. ARG0 is the nick!hostmask of the sender. ARG1 is an array
reference containing the nick(s) of the recipients. ARG2 is the text
of the message.

=item C<irc_nick>

Sent whenever you, or someone around you, changes nicks. ARG0 is the
nick!hostmask of the changer. ARG1 is the new nick that they changed
to.

=item C<irc_notice>

Sent whenever you receive a NOTICE command. ARG0 is the nick!hostmask
of the sender. ARG1 is an array reference containing the nick(s) or
channel name(s) of the recipients. ARG2 is the text of the NOTICE
message.

=item C<irc_part>

Sent whenever someone leaves a channel that you're on. ARG0 is the
person's nick!hostmask. ARG1 is the channel name. ARG2 is the part message.

=item C<irc_ping>

An event sent whenever the server sends a PING query to the
client. (Don't confuse this with a CTCP PING, which is another beast
entirely. If unclear, read the RFC.) Note that POE::Component::IRC will
automatically take care of sending the PONG response back to the
server for you, although you can still register to catch the event for
informational purposes.

=item C<irc_public>

Sent whenever you receive a PRIVMSG command that was sent to a
channel. ARG0 is the nick!hostmask of the sender. ARG1 is an array
reference containing the channel name(s) of the recipients. ARG2 is
the text of the message.

=item C<irc_quit>

Sent whenever someone on a channel with you quits IRC (or gets
KILLed). ARG0 is the nick!hostmask of the person in question. ARG1 is
the clever, witty message they left behind on the way out.

=item C<irc_socketerr>

Sent when a connection couldn't be established to the IRC server. ARG0
is probably some vague and/or misleading reason for what failed.

=item C<irc_topic>

Sent when a channel topic is set or unset. ARG0 is the nick!hostmask of the
sender. ARG1 is the channel affected. ARG2 will be either: a string if the
topic is being set; or a zero-length string (ie. '') if the topic is being
unset. Note: replies to queries about what a channel topic *is*
(ie. TOPIC #channel) , are returned as numerics, not with this event.


=item C<irc_whois>

Sent in response to a 'whois' query. ARG0 is a hashref, with the following
keys: 

'nick', the users nickname; 

'user', the users username; 

'host', their hostname;

'real', their real name;

'idle', their idle time in seconds;

'signon', the epoch time they signed on (will be undef if ircd does not support
this);

'channels', an arrayref listing visible channels they are on, the channel is
prefixed with '@','+','%' depending on whether they have +o +v or +h;

'server', their server ( might not be useful on some networks );

'oper', whether they are an IRCop, contains the IRC operator string if they are, 
undef if they aren't.

'actually', some ircds report the users actual ip address, that'll be here;

On Freenode if the user has identified with NICKSERV there will be an
additional key:

'identified'.

=item C<irc_whowas>

Similar to the above, except some keys will be missing.

=item C<irc_raw>

Enabled by passing 'Raw' => 1 to spawn() or connect(), ARG0 is the raw IRC
string received by the component from the IRC server, before it has been
mangled by filters and such like.

=item C<irc_registered>

Sent once to the requesting session on registration ( see register() ). ARG0
is a reference tothe component's object.

=item C<irc_shutdown>

Sent to all registered sessions when the component has been asked to
shutdown(). ARG0 will be the session ID of the requesting session.

=item C<irc_isupport>

Emitted by the first event after an irc_005, to indicate that isupport
information has been gathered. ARG0 is the
L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ISupport|POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::ISupport>
object.

=item C<irc_delay_set>

Emitted on a succesful addition of a delayed event using delay() method. ARG0
will be the alarm_id which can be used later with delay_remove(). Subsequent
parameters are the arguments that were passed to delay().

=item C<irc_delay_removed>

Emitted when a delayed command is successfully removed. ARG0 will be the
alarm_id that was removed. Subsequent parameters are the arguments that were
passed to delay().

=item C<irc_socks_failed>

Emitted whenever we fail to connect successfully to a SOCKS server or the
SOCKS server is not actually a SOCKS server. ARG0 will be some vague reason
as to what went wrong. Hopefully.

=item C<irc_socks_rejected>

Emitted whenever a SOCKS connection is rejected by a SOCKS server. ARG0 is
the SOCKS code, ARG1 the SOCKS server address, ARG2 the SOCKS port and ARG3
the SOCKS user id ( if defined ).

=item All numeric events (see RFC 1459)

Most messages from IRC servers are identified only by three-digit
numeric codes with undescriptive constant names like RPL_UMODEIS and
ERR_NOTOPLEVEL. (Actually, the list of codes in the RFC is kind of
out-of-date... the list in the back of Net::IRC::Event.pm is more
complete, and different IRC networks have different and incompatible
lists. Ack!) As an example, say you wanted to handle event 376
(RPL_ENDOFMOTD, which signals the end of the MOTD message). You'd
register for '376', and listen for 'irc_376' events. Simple, no? ARG0
is the name of the server which sent the message. ARG1 is the text of
the message. ARG2 is an ARRAYREF of the parsed message, so there is no
need to parse ARG1 yourself.

=back

=head2 Somewhat Less Important Events

=over

=item C<irc_dcc_chat>

Notifies you that one line of text has been received from the
client on the other end of a DCC CHAT connection. ARG0 is the
connection's magic cookie, ARG1 is the nick of the person on the other
end, ARG2 is the port number, and ARG3 is the text they sent.

=item C<irc_dcc_done>

You receive this event when a DCC connection terminates normally.
Abnormal terminations are reported by "irc_dcc_error", below. ARG0 is
the connection's magic cookie, ARG1 is the nick of the person on the
other end, ARG2 is the DCC type (CHAT, SEND, GET, etc.), and ARG3 is the
port number. For DCC SEND and GET connections, ARG4 will be the
filename, ARG5 will be the file size, and ARG6 will be the number of
bytes transferred. (ARG5 and ARG6 should always be the same.)

=item C<irc_dcc_failed>

You get this event when a DCC connection fails for some reason. ARG0 
will be the operation that failed, ARG1 is the error number, ARG2 is
the description of the error and ARG3 the connection's magic cookie.

=item C<irc_dcc_error>

You get this event whenever a DCC connection or connection attempt
terminates unexpectedly or suffers some fatal error. ARG0 will be the
connection's magic cookie, ARG1 will be a string describing the error.
ARG2 will be the nick of the person on the other end of the connection.
ARG3 is the DCC type (SEND, GET, CHAT, etc.). ARG4 is the port number of
the DCC connection, if any. For SEND and GET connections, ARG5 is the
filename, ARG6 is the expected file size, and ARG7 is the transfered size.

=item C<irc_dcc_get>

Notifies you that another block of data has been successfully
transferred from the client on the other end of your DCC GET connection.

the other end, ARG2 is the port number, ARG3 is the filename, ARG4 is
the total file size, and ARG5 is the number of bytes successfully
transferred so far.

=item C<irc_dcc_request>

You receive this event when another IRC client sends you a DCC SEND or
CHAT request out of the blue. You can examine the request and decide
whether or not to accept it here. ARG0 is the nick of the client on the
other end. ARG1 is the type of DCC request (CHAT, SEND, etc.). ARG2 is
the port number. ARG3 is a "magic cookie" argument, suitable for sending
with 'dcc_accept' events to signify that you want to accept the
connection (see the 'dcc_accept' docs). For DCC SEND and GET
connections, ARG4 will be the filename, and ARG5 will be the file size.

=item C<irc_dcc_send>

Notifies you that another block of data has been successfully
transferred from you to the client on the other end of a DCC SEND
connection. ARG0 is the connection's magic cookie, ARG1 is the nick of
the person on the other end, ARG2 is the port number, ARG3 is the
filename, ARG4 is the total file size, and ARG5 is the number of bytes
successfully transferred so far.

 # bboetts puny try to get dcc resume implemented in this great module:
 # ARG0 is the well known 'magic cookie' (as in dcc_send etc.)
 # ARG1 is the (eventually new) name of the file
 # ARG2 is the size from which will be resumed
 # usage and example:

 sub irc_dcc_request {
     my ($kernel, $nick, $type, $port, $magic, $filename, $size) =
         @_[KERNEL, ARG0 .. ARG5];

     print "DCC $type request from $nick on port $port\n";

=head1 SIGNALS

The component will handle a number of custom signals that you may send using 
L<POE::Kernel|POE::Kernel> signal() method.

=over

=item C<POCOIRC_REGISTER>

Registering with multiple PoCo-IRC components has been a pita. Well, no more,
using the power of L<POE::Kernel|POE::Kernel> signals.

If the component receives a 'POCOIRC_REGISTER' signal it'll register the
requesting session and trigger an 'irc_registered' event. From that event one
can get all the information necessary such as the poco-irc object and the
SENDER session to do whatever one needs to build a poco-irc dispatch table.

The way the signal handler in PoCo-IRC is written also supports sending the 
'POCOIRC_REGISTER' to multiple sessions simultaneously, by sending the signal
to the POE Kernel itself.

Pass the signal your session, session ID or alias, and the IRC events (as
specified to 'register').

To register with multiple PoCo-IRCs one can do the following in your session's
_start handler:

 sub _start {
     my ($kernel, $session) = @_[KERNEL, SESSION];

     # Registering with multiple pocoircs for 'all' IRC events
     $kernel->signal( $kernel, 'POCOIRC_REGISTER', $session->ID(), 'all' );

     return:
 }

Each poco-irc will send your session an 'irc_registered' event:

 sub irc_registered {
     my ($kernel, $sender, $heap, $irc_object) = @_[KERNEL, SENDER, HEAP, ARG0];
     
     # Get the poco-irc session ID 
     my $sender_id = $sender->ID();
     
     # Or it's alias
     my $poco_alias = $irc_object->session_alias();

     # Store it in our heap maybe
     $heap->{irc_objects}->{ $sender_id } = $irc_object;

     # Make the poco connect 
     $irc_object->yield( connect => { } );

     return;
 }

=item C<POCOIRC_SHUTDOWN>

Telling multiple poco-ircs to shutdown was a pita as well. The same principle as
with registering applies to shutdown too.

Send a 'POCOIRC_SHUTDOWN' to the POE Kernel to terminate all the active
poco-ircs simultaneously.

 $poe_kernel->signal( $poe_kernel, 'POCOIRC_SHUTDOWN' );

Any additional parameters passed to the signal will become your quit messages
on each IRC network.
