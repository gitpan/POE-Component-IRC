Revision history for Perl extension POE::Component::IRC.

2.4   Thu Oct 10 14:22:04 PDT 2002
    - Added a patch from dngor to fix a crash caused by IRC servers
      sometimes inexplicably sending a blank line.
    - Added a patch from Jim Westfall which speeds up DCC file transfers
      by a couple orders of magnitude. Yay, Jim!

2.3   Fri Sep  6 07:59:50 PDT 2002
    - Fixed a rare "uninitialized value" warning in oneoptarg().
    - Added a patch from Trym Skaar which makes sure that DCC buffers
      are flushed before closing a connection. Thanks, Trym!

2.2   Fri May 24 13:00:44 PDT 2002
    - dngor found an excellent page about IRC server numeric codes,
      which I added a link to in the documentation.
    - dngor also gave me two more patches: one to avoid some deprecation
      warnings introduced in the latest version of POE, and another
      which fixed a bug in one of his earlier patches. He's such a stud.

2.1   Mon Mar  4 17:06:03 PST 2002
    - Added a long-buried patch from thefly to fix IRCnet channel name
      parsing. Sorry about the long turnaround on that one.
    - Applied Scott Beck's patch to Rocco's refcount patch. The whole
      "sessions not being GCed" brain-damage should be fixed now.

2.0   Fri Feb 22 15:23:23 PST 2002
    - Rocco Caputo gave me two patches to apply; the first was a fix to
      his earlier output throttling patch, and the second was a snippet
      of code that will allow bot-writers to avoid having to set aliases
      on their control sessions to keep them alive. Cool!

1.9   Wed Dec 12 22:44:13 PST 2001
    - David Dollar pointed out a bug with DCC using the wrong interface
      on multihomed hosts. Easy fix.

1.8   Mon Dec 10 16:04:06 PST 2001
    - Applied dngor's studly patch to throttle line output.
    - Fixed a bug that would cause events to get thrown away if they
      came in while the connection to the IRC server was down.

1.7   Sat Jul 21 00:46:06 PDT 2001
    - Fixed bugs in my initial implementations of the irc_invite event.
      Sigh. You ever have one of those days where you can't do anything
      right? Thanks again to the exceedingly patient Rasmus Hansen for
      pointing out that my updated version still didn't work right.
    - Fixed a bug in 'dcc_close' which prevented it from calling
      'irc_dcc_done' handlers properly.

1.5   Thu Jul  5 15:24:31 PDT 2001
    - Added an irc_invite event -- I knew I'd forgotten something!
      Thanks to Rasmus Hansen for the bug report.
    - Fixed a bug in topic() that would accidentally clear the topic
      when trying to query it. More thanks to Rasmus Hansen.

1.4   Mon Jul  2 17:10:59 PDT 2001
    - One of the fixes in 1.3 broke newline handling horribly, such that
      it was sending two sets of line terminators on every line. I am a
      doofus. Patched by Rocco Caputo.

1.3   Sat Jun 30 17:29:30 PDT 2001
    - The Indomitable Mark-Jason "Ominous" Dominus sent me so many
      patches and bug reports I'm almost at a loss to list them all.
      Among others, DCC SENDs no longer report the local pathname to the
      client on the other end, multiple concurrent DCC connections work,
      and some documentation errors have been fixed.
    - Many thanks to the infinitely studly Kees Cook, who, in addition
      to having a really cool name, sent me a big patch for lots of DCC
      bugs. DCC connections will now report errors and close their
      sockets properly! Woohoo! Also, 'irc_dcc_error' events give you
      more information about the connection that failed, and the
      'dcc_accept' event now lets you rename incoming DCC files.
    - Fixed a silly bug; sl() was sending \n instead of \r\n as a line
      terminator.
    - Changed lots of Filter::CTCP die()s to warn()s, on the advice of
      Peter Barabas. Thanks, Peter!

1.2   Thu May 24 02:36:40 PDT 2001
    - I have learned a valuable lesson about not including debugging
      prints in released code. Especially when the debugging code in
      question consists of somewhat vulgar inside jokes. :-)

1.1   Fri Mar  2 03:07:01 PST 2001
    - A couple patches from Jonathan Steinert: 'ctcp', 'privmsg', and
      'notice' will join() their arguments together with spaces, and
      'kick' will no longer accidentally concatenate the nick onto the
      kick message. Thanks, Jon!

1.0   Wed Feb 21 15:09:56 PST 2001
    - Split 'irc_ctcp' messages into 'irc_ctcp' and 'irc_ctcpreply'.
      My thanks to Jonathan Steinert.
    - Rocco "dngor" Caputo fixed up my DCC code for me, which was so
      broken as to exercise POE::Kernel bugs. :-) With his fixes in
      mind, I rewrote pretty much all the DCC stuff; it's much less
      hairy now.
    - Added 'dcc_chat' and 'dcc_accept' commands.
    - Moved all scripts into the "examples" directory and added a dummy
      test.pl, so it won't hang during CPAN installations anymore.
    - Worked around a bug in POE versions <0.1201, which caused DCC
      SEND/GET connections not to properly respond to pending data.
    - DCC connections should function properly now. Let me know if you
      experience problems.

1.0b  Sat Jan 13 14:49:22 PST 2001
    - This is a beta release. It may not entirely work, and DCC receive
      is still unimplemented. I'll list the bugs I remember fixing below.
      1.0 final will have DCC receive capability, I promise!
    - CTCP event names are now in the form of "irc_ctcp_ping" or
      whatever. See the POD documentation.
    - CTCP events now actually include the sender and recipient names.
    - The infamous "Not an ARRAY reference" bug should now go away. Make
      sure you're using a recent version of POE! Turned out it was a bug
      in POE::Filter::Line.

0.15  Tue Aug 10 19:21:58 EDT 1999
    - Well, it sucked for the first revision, at least. In my eager haste,
      I released the CTCP code with numerous debugging prints scattered
      throughout the source, some serious brokenness in mixed-mode
      messages, and a totally unimplemented put() method. All fixed! You
      can now actually send CTCP messages with the 'ctcp' and 'ctcpreply'
      events. Now to hack on DCC...

0.14  Sun Aug  8 18:29:46 EDT 1999
    - Wrote documentation for POE::Filter::IRC.
    - Moved Filter.pm to Filter-IRC.pm, in preparation for adding a
      CTCP filter.
    - Addi <amh@mbl.is> fixed a nasty bug with public/msg handling in
      the Filter-IRC module. I am SUCH a neen.
    - Finally sat down and wrote the bloody CTCP filter, at long last.
      Don't be surprised if it sucks for the first few revisions... the
      last one I wrote did, too. On the other hand, this uses big chunks
      of the working code from that effort, so maybe I'll get lucky this
      time.

0.13  Fri Jun  4 03:56:13 EDT 1999
    - Split the parser off into a separate POE::Filter::IRC module.
      The surgery was surprisingly easy, but I had to do an ugly
      Makefile.PL hack to get it to install correctly.

0.12  Fri Jun  4 01:16:55 EDT 1999
    - Wrote a nice README, finally.
    - Fixed a bug in the test.pl script where I accidentally referred
      to the 'irc_disconnected' event as 'irc_disconnect'. No wonder it
      wasn't shutting down properly.

0.11  Thu Jun  3 18:41:51 EDT 1999
    - Spruced up the parser's regexps with a lot of " +"'s.
    - Turned off all the massively verbose debugging code.
    - Realized that I need to write a README.

0.1   Thu Jun  3 16:55:24 EDT 1999
    - Completely functional, minus CTCP and DCC.

0.1a  Mon May 17 09:11:48 EDT 1999
    - Released for a little private QA to oznoid and dngor. Moderately
      functional. Can send every command (I think), and has a
      half-written parser that handles the most common IRC events, and
      a few which it wasn't meant to handle.
