      status in WHO replies ( like unreal ). Thanks to Kinks
      for reporting that.
    - 'irc_dcc_failed' event was undocumented. Fixed.
    - Switched the poco-client-dns checks to 'use', so as to

      a second argument to /dump_state command.

      to enjoy the mode parsing State does internally - Kinks
    - Refactored ::Qnet::State subclass after all Kinks' 
      changes to ::State.
    - Refactored ::State slightly to use ARG2 for numerics 
      handlers instead of trying to parse ARG1 ourselves. FTW.

    - Added event handlers for PING and PONG IRC commands.
    - Added connected() method, so punters can query if the 
      component is connected to an IRC server or not.
    - Applied a patch from Apocalypse re: DNS and SSL.
    - Fixed Filter::IRC so it now parses PONG properly.
    - ketas pointed out that in State.pm, the state for a 
      channel wasn't getting deleted when the bot parted or 
      got kicked. Fixed.

4.3   Wed Apr 20 09:25:21 BST 2005
    - Added 'irc_raw' events and parameter to spawn/connect() to
      enable them. Thanks to webfox for the idea.

4.2   Thu Apr 14 12:00:00 BST 2005
    - Minor changes to State.pm to delete the STATE info when
      we disconnect, error or socketerr.
    - Reorganised the distribution.

4.1   Mon Apr 11 11:24:44 BST 2005
    - NATAddr bug spotted by apeiron @ MAGnet. Fixed.
    - webfox spotted a problem with whois plugin and POE
      Kernel assert_default. Hopefully fixed.

4.0   Tue Apr 05 10:39:42 BST 2005
    - Fixed a minor bug in Filter-IRC.pm, where it wasn't
      decoloning the mode line before splitting it. 
      Thanks to webfox for pointing it out.
    - Used eval's to make plugins system safe from rogue
      plugins. *tssk* *tssk*
    - Plugins system will now try to send events to a plugin
      method _default() if the call to S_* or U_* fails.
    - Applied a patch from webfox to enable SSL 
      connections. \o/
    - Ported SSL patch to all dependent sub-classes.
    - Teased and fixed a bug in IRC-State.pm. ban_mask() 
      should work properly now.
    - paulv @ MAGnet pointed out that spawn() and connect()
      arguments are case-sensitive. Adapted his patch. Args
      can be in any case now.

3.9   Mon Mar 21 09:17:05 GMT 2005
    - Applied patches from webfox @ MAGnet for UnrealIRCd
      support in IRC-State.pm and Plugin-State.pm.
    - Added plugin_list().

3.8   Mon Mar 14 10:15:22 GMT 2005
    - Applied ketas' DCC patch, eventually.
    - Applied a patch from Zsolt Szalai, which adds support
      for Freenode's 320 whois response.
    - Added Apocalypse's port of IRC-State.pm using the plugin
      API, Plugin-State.pm.
    - Added my plugin for 'irc_whois' and 'irc_whowas' 
      functionality.
    - Fixed all the necessary modules to use Whois plugin.

3.7   Fri Mar 04 17:37:34 GMT 2005
    - Applied massive patch from Apocalypse @ MAGnet that
      adds plugins. Read the docs in Plugins.pm for more info.
    - Corrected some grammar mistakes in Plugins.pm >:o)
    - Amended IRC-State.pm so that 'irc_nick' and 'irc_quit'
      have an additional parameter in ARG2 which is an 
      arrayref of channels that are common with the component.

3.6   Tue Mar 01 17:47:05 GMT 2005 "Y Adeilad Daffydd-Sant" 
				   ( The Saint David Build(ing) )
    - Applied ketas' patch to IRC-State. Adds channel_modes
      method and some code tidying.
    - Spotted that in some cases the component *needs* an
      alias. Made it use an internal alias unless one is 
      specified.
    - Applied another ketas patch to IRC.pm, puts a 
      friendly message when we can't allocate a DCC port.
    - Updated IRC-Qnet-State.pm to use a 'querytype' in the 
      extended WHO command, to specify <channel> or <nick>
      WHO queries, due to spurious channels appearing in the
      state. Big thanks to MikeC @ Qnet for the pointers.

3.5   Wed Feb 23 13:28:05 GMT 2005
    - IRC-State bug spotted and patched by ketas @ MAGnet
    - Same bug caught and squashed in IRC-Qnet-State by me.
    - Sorted out DCCPorts. It has to be an arrayref now.

3.4   Fri Feb 18 12:01:58 GMT 2005
    - Deprecated new() in favour of new constructor spawn().
      spawn() will except all the same parameters as connect().
      Moved config stuff to _configure() to save duplication.
    - Changed all the object constructors about. Bit tedious
      but now it is alot easier to subclass. See _create().
    - Added a hack for $self->session_id(). Made 'alias' 
      optional if used with 'spawn'.
    - Added parameter NATPort so one can specify the NAT
      address that a bot appears to other IRC clients as
      for DCC transfers, etc.
    - Added DCCPorts parameter so that one can specify a
      range of ports to use for initiating DCC, instead of
      using 0.
    - Implemented and added subclass ::State which provides
      nickname and channel tracking. \o/
    - Implemented and added subclass ::Qnet::State the ::State
      ported to the Qnet module.
    - Fixed the event dispatchers in _sock_up and _sock_down to
      use _send_event like everyone else. Danke to Apocalypse for
      spotting that. Amended _send_event so that 'irc_connected'
      and 'irc_disconnected' get sent to every session not just 
      those that ask for it, as was the original behaviour.
    - Documentation updates for all the new stuff.
    - Added CVSLOG which contains all the glorious changes in
      developing this thingy. :)
    - Added send_queue() method, as I noticed that merlyn's 
      logfile tailing code was accessing the heap and i moved all
      heap stuff to the object. *sigh* hacked it so that $heap holds
      a reference to $self->{send_queue} which should work.

3.3   Wed Feb 02 14:07:03 GMT 2005
    - Updated IRC-Qnet to a). support new whois/whowas;
      b). support irc_330 which is the account on ircu.

3.2   Wed Feb 02 11:00:59 GMT 2005
    - Implemented 'irc_whois' and 'irc_whowas' which
      gather all the salient data from the numeric replies
      and send one event containing a hashref.
      As suggested by numerous bods on #PoE @ MAGnet >;o)

3.1   Fri Jan 21 11:59:56 GMT 2005
    - Converted _send_event sub to object method.
    - Added IRC-Qnet, with specific extensions for Quakenet.
    - Updated README

3.0   Fri Dec 31 09:00:01 GMT 2004
    - Fixed Filter-IRC so that it groks WALLOPS properly.
    - Added docs/ and populated it with rfcs applicable to IRC.
    - Added a slightly more substantial test case, moved it to t/
    - Converted use of HEAP to OBJECT. PoCo-IRC is *now* an object.
    - Added a fix for the infamous PART bug. Has to be explicitly enabled
      by specifying PartFix => 1 in the 'connect' handler.
    - Added a switch to 'connect' so that the use of PoCo::Client::DNS
      can be disabled if necessary.
    - Applied the outstanding patches:
	- PoCo::Client::DNS patch by Jim Westfall
	- DCC Resume patch by Bruno Boettcher
	- Flood doc patch by Rocco Caputo
	- Debug param patch by Paul Visscher
	- Proxy Support patch by Jeff Pinyan
	- Locops patch by Jon Nistor

========== Maintainership changed from Fimm to BinGOs ====================

2.9   Sat Jul 19 13:32:45 PDT 2003
    - Only one change this time: Adam Foxson's patch to add prioritized
      notices.

2.8   Sat Jun  7 16:13:25 PDT 2003
    - Applied dngor's mega-patch, which fixes (among other things): a
      fix for a nasty lockup, improved error reporting, and better flood
      control.
    - Fixed some broken URLs and a couple mistakes in the documentation.

2.7   Sun Feb  2 15:05:28 PST 2003
    - Fixed up the example scripts to play nicer with POE's new signal
      handling. Thanks to dngor for bringing this up.
    - Added a patch by lunartear to properly handle spaces in DCC filenames.
    - Fixed a bug reported by Robert Rendler regarding CTCP quoting
      accidentally duplicating backslashes.

2.6   Wed Dec 11 20:27:51 PST 2002
    - Brian Kelly thoughtfully pointed out an URL in the documentation
      that was being mangled by pod2html. Should look better now.
    - Added a note about handling CTCP actions to the POD documentation,
      since that seems to be a source of confusion for a lot of people.
    - Added a 'list' event, which I seem to have overlooked entirely
      until now. Thanks to J.D. McCown for pointing it out.
    - Attempted to add Jim Westfall's asynchronous DNS patch, but I
      really need to learn a little more about IPv6 before I attempt to
      port somebody else's code to it. Hopefully in the next release.

2.5   Sun Oct 27 11:03:57 PST 2002
    - Added an AIM <-> IRC proxy bot to the example scripts. Share and enjoy!
    - I just now noticed that POE::Component::IRC sessions never get
      garbage-collected. DOH. Now you can send them "shutdown" events to
      make them go away. Too bad it's probably too late to be breaking
      backwards compatibility on this... sigh.
    - Added a bug fix from Trym Skaar (those Norwegians get the coolest
      names!) which fixes a potential crash while closing DCC connections.
    - Added a mega-patch from the unstoppable Rocco Caputo which prioritizes
      messages sent to the IRC server by importance. This ensures that
      pings and login information will always keep flowing, even if your
      bot's inane chatter has been throttled.

2.4   Thu Oct 10 14:22:04 PDT 2002
    - Added a patch from dngor to fix a crash caused by IRC servers
      sometimes inexplicably sending a blank line.
    - Added a patch from Jim Westfall which speeds up DCC file transfers
      by a couple orders of magnitude. Yay, Jim!

2.3   Fri Sep  6 07:59:50 PDT 2002
    - Fixed a rare "uninitialized value" warning in oneoptarg().
    - Added a patch from Trym Skaar which makes sure that DCC buffers
      are flushed before closing a connection. Thanks, Trym!

2.2   Fri May 24 13:00:44 PDT 2002
    - dngor found an excellent page about IRC server numeric codes,
      which I added a link to in the documentation.
    - dngor also gave me two more patches: one to avoid some deprecation
      warnings introduced in the latest version of POE, and another
      which fixed a bug in one of his earlier patches. He's such a stud.

2.1   Mon Mar  4 17:06:03 PST 2002
    - Added a long-buried patch from thefly to fix IRCnet channel name
      parsing. Sorry about the long turnaround on that one.
    - Applied Scott Beck's patch to Rocco's refcount patch. The whole
      "sessions not being GCed" brain-damage should be fixed now.

2.0   Fri Feb 22 15:23:23 PST 2002
    - Rocco Caputo gave me two patches to apply; the first was a fix to
      his earlier output throttling patch, and the second was a snippet
      of code that will allow bot-writers to avoid having to set aliases
      on their control sessions to keep them alive. Cool!

1.9   Wed Dec 12 22:44:13 PST 2001
    - David Dollar pointed out a bug with DCC using the wrong interface
      on multihomed hosts. Easy fix.

1.8   Mon Dec 10 16:04:06 PST 2001
    - Applied dngor's studly patch to throttle line output.
    - Fixed a bug that would cause events to get thrown away if they
      came in while the connection to the IRC server was down.

1.7   Sat Jul 21 00:46:06 PDT 2001
    - Fixed bugs in my initial implementations of the irc_invite event.
      Sigh. You ever have one of those days where you can't do anything
      right? Thanks again to the exceedingly patient Rasmus Hansen for
      pointing out that my updated version still didn't work right.
    - Fixed a bug in 'dcc_close' which prevented it from calling
      'irc_dcc_done' handlers properly.

1.5   Thu Jul  5 15:24:31 PDT 2001
    - Added an irc_invite event -- I knew I'd forgotten something!
      Thanks to Rasmus Hansen for the bug report.
    - Fixed a bug in topic() that would accidentally clear the topic
      when trying to query it. More thanks to Rasmus Hansen.

1.4   Mon Jul  2 17:10:59 PDT 2001
    - One of the fixes in 1.3 broke newline handling horribly, such that
      it was sending two sets of line terminators on every line. I am a
      doofus. Patched by Rocco Caputo.

1.3   Sat Jun 30 17:29:30 PDT 2001
    - The Indomitable Mark-Jason "Ominous" Dominus sent me so many
      patches and bug reports I'm almost at a loss to list them all.
      Among others, DCC SENDs no longer report the local pathname to the
      client on the other end, multiple concurrent DCC connections work,
      and some documentation errors have been fixed.
    - Many thanks to the infinitely studly Kees Cook, who, in addition
      to having a really cool name, sent me a big patch for lots of DCC
      bugs. DCC connections will now report errors and close their
      sockets properly! Woohoo! Also, 'irc_dcc_error' events give you
      more information about the connection that failed, and the
      'dcc_accept' event now lets you rename incoming DCC files.
    - Fixed a silly bug; sl() was sending \n instead of \r\n as a line
      terminator.
    - Changed lots of Filter::CTCP die()s to warn()s, on the advice of
      Peter Barabas. Thanks, Peter!

1.2   Thu May 24 02:36:40 PDT 2001
    - I have learned a valuable lesson about not including debugging
      prints in released code. Especially when the debugging code in
      question consists of somewhat vulgar inside jokes. :-)

1.1   Fri Mar  2 03:07:01 PST 2001
    - A couple patches from Jonathan Steinert: 'ctcp', 'privmsg', and
      'notice' will join() their arguments together with spaces, and
      'kick' will no longer accidentally concatenate the nick onto the
      kick message. Thanks, Jon!

1.0   Wed Feb 21 15:09:56 PST 2001
    - Split 'irc_ctcp' messages into 'irc_ctcp' and 'irc_ctcpreply'.
      My thanks to Jonathan Steinert.
    - Rocco "dngor" Caputo fixed up my DCC code for me, which was so
      broken as to exercise POE::Kernel bugs. :-) With his fixes in
      mind, I rewrote pretty much all the DCC stuff; it's much less
      hairy now.
    - Added 'dcc_chat' and 'dcc_accept' commands.
    - Moved all scripts into the "examples" directory and added a dummy
      test.pl, so it won't hang during CPAN installations anymore.
    - Worked around a bug in POE versions <0.1201, which caused DCC
      SEND/GET connections not to properly respond to pending data.
    - DCC connections should function properly now. Let me know if you
      experience problems.

1.0b  Sat Jan 13 14:49:22 PST 2001
    - This is a beta release. It may not entirely work, and DCC receive
      is still unimplemented. I'll list the bugs I remember fixing below.
      1.0 final will have DCC receive capability, I promise!
    - CTCP event names are now in the form of "irc_ctcp_ping" or
      whatever. See the POD documentation.
    - CTCP events now actually include the sender and recipient names.
    - The infamous "Not an ARRAY reference" bug should now go away. Make
      sure you're using a recent version of POE! Turned out it was a bug
      in POE::Filter::Line.

0.15  Tue Aug 10 19:21:58 EDT 1999
    - Well, it sucked for the first revision, at least. In my eager haste,
      I released the CTCP code with numerous debugging prints scattered
      throughout the source, some serious brokenness in mixed-mode
      messages, and a totally unimplemented put() method. All fixed! You
      can now actually send CTCP messages with the 'ctcp' and 'ctcpreply'
      events. Now to hack on DCC...

0.14  Sun Aug  8 18:29:46 EDT 1999
    - Wrote documentation for POE::Filter::IRC.
    - Moved Filter.pm to Filter-IRC.pm, in preparation for adding a
      CTCP filter.
    - Addi <amh@mbl.is> fixed a nasty bug with public/msg handling in
      the Filter-IRC module. I am SUCH a neen.
    - Finally sat down and wrote the bloody CTCP filter, at long last.
      Don't be surprised if it sucks for the first few revisions... the
      last one I wrote did, too. On the other hand, this uses big chunks
      of the working code from that effort, so maybe I'll get lucky this
      time.

0.13  Fri Jun  4 03:56:13 EDT 1999
    - Split the parser off into a separate POE::Filter::IRC module.
      The surgery was surprisingly easy, but I had to do an ugly
      Makefile.PL hack to get it to install correctly.

0.12  Fri Jun  4 01:16:55 EDT 1999
    - Wrote a nice README, finally.
    - Fixed a bug in the test.pl script where I accidentally referred
      to the 'irc_disconnected' event as 'irc_disconnect'. No wonder it
      wasn't shutting down properly.

0.11  Thu Jun  3 18:41:51 EDT 1999
    - Spruced up the parser's regexps with a lot of " +"'s.
    - Turned off all the massively verbose debugging code.
    - Realized that I need to write a README.

0.1   Thu Jun  3 16:55:24 EDT 1999
    - Completely functional, minus CTCP and DCC.

0.1a  Mon May 17 09:11:48 EDT 1999
    - Released for a little private QA to oznoid and dngor. Moderately
      functional. Can send every command (I think), and has a
      half-written parser that handles the most common IRC events, and
      a few which it wasn't meant to handle.
