Test failures to fix
--------------------------

These tests fail on 6.04.

I haven't been able to reproduce these FAILs on my machines. Maybe that's
because I only have Linux ones, and all these failures were reported on
non-Linux machines. -- Hinrik

* FAIL  3478590 5.10.0 on Netbsd 4.0.1 (alpha-netbsd)
~~~~~~~~

    t/04_plugins/09_nickreclaim/02_reclaim......# Looks like you planned 6 tests but ran 1 extra.
    dubious
        Test returned status 255 (wstat 65280, 0xff00)
    DIED. FAILED test 7
        Failed 1/6 tests, 83.33% okay

Ran 1 extra? It's at times like these that I wish CPAN testers always printed
verbose test output, so I'd know which test ran more often than it should have.

t/04_plugins/17_dcc/03_send.t passes on this machine, so maybe the FAIL has
something to do with spaces in filenames on Windows?

Looks like the "--- TestBot1 is now known as NewNick" message didn't make it
to the log file for some reason.
